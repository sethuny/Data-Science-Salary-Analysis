Data Science Salaries Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Introduction
This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) conducted on a dataset containing information about data science salaries from the years 2020 to 2022. The main objective of this analysis is to gain insights into the trends and patterns in data science salaries over time and across various factors such as job title, company size, and remote working ratio.

Dataset:

The dataset used in this analysis contains the following columns:

Working_Year: The year of employment.
Designation: Job title or role within the organization.
Experience: Years of experience in the field.
Employment_Status: Status of employment (e.g., full-time, part-time).
Salary_In_Rupees: Salary of the employee in Rupees.
Employee_Location: Location of the employee.
Company_Location: Location of the company.
Company_Size: Size of the company (e.g., small, medium, large).
Remote_Working_Ratio: Ratio of remote working hours to total working hours.
The data underwent preprocessing steps to handle missing values and ensure suitability for analysis.

Average Salary by Designation: Investigates the relationship between job title and salary, identifying top-paying roles.
Average Salary by Experience: Explores how salary varies based on years of experience.
Salary Growth Over Years: Examines the trend of salary growth from 2020 to 2022.
Average Salary by Company Size: Analyzes the impact of company size on data science salaries.
Remote Working Ratio Analysis: Investigates the distribution of remote working ratios among data science professionals and its correlation with salary and job title.
